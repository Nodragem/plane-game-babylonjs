Hello,

I am trying to use splitChunks in Webpack 4, expecting to bundle the modules in node_modules into one bundle that won't be re-compiled each time I make a change to my code.

I added this code in my webpack.config.js:

    optimization: {
       splitChunks: {
          chunks: 'all'
       }
    },
    

And I added this line in my index.html:

    <script src="./vendors~app.js"></script>


The file 'vendor~app.js' being the new bundle generated.

When I run the webpack-dev-server the first time, it says:

    Built at: 2018-09-13 13:32:47
                 Asset      Size  Chunks                    Chunk Names
                app.js  3.15 KiB       0  [emitted]         app
        vendors~app.js  1.91 MiB       1  [emitted]  [big]  vendors~app
            app.js.map  13.7 KiB       0  [emitted]         app
    vendors~app.js.map  3.98 MiB       1  [emitted]         vendors~app

When I make a change to my source code and save, the webpack-dev-server starts compiling as expected and says:

    Built at: 2018-09-13 13:33:46
                 Asset      Size  Chunks                    Chunk Names
                app.js  3.16 KiB       0  [emitted]         app
        vendors~app.js  1.91 MiB       1  [emitted]  [big]  vendors~app
            app.js.map  13.7 KiB       0  [emitted]         app
    vendors~app.js.map  3.98 MiB       1  [emitted]         vendors~app


I was expecting the compiler not to re-compile vendors~app.js!
I thought that was the point of using splitChunks? Am I wrong? how can I avoid the compiler to re-compile vendors~app.js?

Thank you very much.
